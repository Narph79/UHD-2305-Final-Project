# UHD-2305-Final-Prorgram

  Purpose:
    This final project package is to implement, through Python programming language, the Prim's Algorithm to evaluate weighted edges of various graphs included within this package.
    Usefuleness: The project will streamline the MST process by showing the correct segements of a graph as well as the weight and will give the user a visual to more easily understand the problem and solution.
    
  How to use: save a copy of the files to your local drive and use the appropirate ide - Anaconda was used for this project and would be recommended that the user use the same.

Final Project Outline: MST Python Package 
For the final project you and your group will write a python package that solves the minimum weight spanning tree problem. More specifically, you will write python code that implements Prim’s Algorithm from scratch. Your package should be partitioned into several python scripts and a subdirectory (folder) that contains several test graphs to test your code on. Your code should be well documented, cleanly written, and should work! This project will be due on the day of your final exam (please check the UHD website for your specific date. Please email me your full projected (compressed as a zip file) to me at DavilaR@uhd.edu. The title of your email should be MATH-2305-Final-Project name1, name2, ... name5

2.	[10 points] The test-graphs directory should contain all weighted edge list text files for each of your sample graphs. Remember, you can create your own sale graphs to test on.
3.	[40 points] The functions script should contain all of your customized helper functions. The functions will be needed to implement Prim’s Algorithm, i.e., functions such as one to compute the cost for the weight of a given edge, or a function to find a new minimum cost edge that can be added during the iteration of Prim’s Algorithm. The functions that you write in functions.py should be well documented. For examples please see: https:// realpython.com/documenting-python-code/
3.	[20 points] Inside the algorithms.py script you should have one function called prims(path/to/graph/data). This function will implement Prim’s Algorithm using the functions you wrote and saved in your functions.py script. This function will solve the MST for a given graph in your data directory.
4.	[20 points] For full credit you will need to document everything that you write according to: https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/
5.	[15 bonus points] If you and your group use Git and Github for this project with an appropriate README.md file in your directory you will receive additional points accordingly.
